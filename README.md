# simple-webserver-c
This is two simple webservers written in C.

The TCP server runs on localhost and can parse html get request and send data back to the browser. It works as a webserver should.

The UDP server & client is a timeserver which sends the time back when you send an empty datagram. It follows the RFC868 time protocol.
